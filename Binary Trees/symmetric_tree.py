Symmetric Tree

PROMPT: 
        Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself
        (i.e., symmetric around its center).
        EXAMPLE TREE:
            Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
            Output: true
                        1
                    2   |   2
                  3   4 | 4   3
                        |
        center line ->  |
        
        Returns: is it symmetric? (bool)
